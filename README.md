A golden canon for mobile.

A combination of having read [this](http://retinart.net/graphic-design/secret-law-of-page-harmony/) article  by [retinart](http://retinart.net/) back in 2010 when I was still interested in print medium and having just learned the basics of web design and discovering responsive mobile first blah blah blah grids. I had been considering designing my personal website as if it was a spread in a magazine. The first thing I could think of as a way to structure my site was the Golden Canons mentioned in the link mention above.

However, designing a spread would only work if the article was much wider than it was tall and clearly reading a blog post on mobile would require some change in direction.

Most reponsive grid systems usually center the content with all their columns flush all across. This would work and it would be fine. However, having been thinking about these canons and print medium, this reminded me of what made these canons so good in the first place. Its was essentially optimize for user interaction with the print/book medium. It was the right margins to read the book in your hands. The way the gutters would fold away, the way your fingers fit over the margins and not your text. 

Clearly some of these guidelines may have merit with a mobile world. 

For example, an 2:3 margin ratio could potentially mean that your thumb does not cover the text or what not. The presence of a screen holder means that the visual weight of the graphics along with your hand may even balance the text even better.

I loved designing content with print. 

Now that I'm working on my personal site of my own designs I'm definitly going to experiement with cleverly treating web as print and see if this has any merit.
