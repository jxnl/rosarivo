                    <p>
The canons of page construction are a set of principles in the field of book design used to describe the ways that page proportions, margins and type areas (print spaces) of books are constructed.

                    <p>
The notion of canons, or laws of form, of book page construction was popularized by Jan Tschichold he wrote </p>
                        <cite>“Though largely forgotten today, methods and rules upon which it is impossible to improve have been developed for centuries. To produce perfect books these rules have to be brought to life and applied. Kayser's 1946 Ein harmonikaler Teilungskanon had earlier used the term canon in this context.

While these canons were initially proposed for book design I want to suggest using some of it's guidelines as a way to better the mobile reading experience. As canons were designed with the physical book in mind, they used various composistion rules to optimize text layout for reading of a book in your hand. I think that these rules can be adapted for

                    <p> 
Tschichold's "golden canon of page construction"[1] is based on simple integer ratios, equivalent to Rosarivo's "typographical divine proportion."

                    <h3>Interpretation of Rosarivo</h3>
                    <p>
Raúl Rosarivo analyzed Renaissance books with the help of a drafting compass and a ruler, and concluded in his Divina proporción tipográfica ("Typographical Divine Proportion", first published in 1947) that Gutenberg, Peter Schöffer, Nicolaus Jenson and others had applied the golden canon of page construction in their works. According to Rosarivo, his work and assertion that Gutenberg used the "golden number" 2:3, or "secret number" as he called it, to establish the harmonic relationships between the diverse parts of a work, was analyzed by experts at the Gutenberg Museum and re-published in the Gutenberg-Jahrbuch, its official magazine. Ros Vicente points out that Rosarivo "demonstrates that Gutenberg had a module different from the well-known one of Luca Pacioli" (the golden ratio).
